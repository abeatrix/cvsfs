%description
The first reason for writing this virtual file system driver was the (in my
opinion) bad usability of cvs. One time i had to check the source of XFree86
to determine what and how it have been changed. To do that i have to checkout
the whole tree of XFree86. This took hours !
My imagination was to access cvs projects as they were ordinary files on
the local disk. So cvsfs was born.

During development some other possible advantages came out.

- When building a package via make it sould be possible to log all file
  accesses to cvs-hosted files. At the end you have a full list of files
  which were required a package. Using a specialized make a subsequent
  run will enable it to analyze the dependencies evaluated during an
  earlier run. This will result in a simplified makefile where each
  target is asigned only the direct source file. The other dependencies
  (*.h files, etc.) can be detected using the file system driver.

- Navigation can be done using ordinary file manager (mc, konquerer, etc.)

- you do not have to checkout files to run make.

- you may use different userids for different modules on the same cvs
  repository.

- you can mount a cvs repository at multiple locations.

- others to come ...
