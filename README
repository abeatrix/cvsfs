This is the first attempt to provide a file system for cvs.
Usage:
------
  mount -t cvsfs [-o options] //<cvs-pserver>/<module> <mount point>
  
  <cvs-pserver>       The cvs pserver to access. This may be a hostname
                      (with or without domain) or a ip-address.
		      Only ip v4 is actually supported !
  <mount point>       The directory where the cvs tree is to be mounted.

Options:
  user=<username>     The username to be used for authentication at the
                      cvs-pserver. If not given the user 'anaonymous' is
		      applied.
  password=<secret>   The password for the username given above. If omitted
                      the a empty password is applied.
  cvsroot=<root>      The cvs root directory. If omitted then /cvsroot is
                      used as default.

		      
If you specify for the actual cvs tool the environment variable

  CVSROOT=:pserver:humbia@sorceforge.net:/cvsroot/project
  
the password is 'secret', the project is named 'myproject' and the moutpoint
will be /humbia then the following command is required:

  mount -t cvsfs -o user=humbia,password=secret,cvsroot=/cvsroot/project \
        //sorceforge.net/myproject /humbia
  

Environment:
------------
Tested (and developed) with SuSE 7.1
mount has version (mount -V) mount-2.10q. This mount version looks for unknown
file systems to locate /bin/mount.<filesystem>. It this file is found it is
executed with the parameters passed to mount. I don't know whether or not
earlier versions on mount have this behaviour. If your version does not do
this search then you can use smbmnt instead.
The module supports only kernels 2.4.x
The vfs module has build problems on nonstandard linux builds with versions
like used for SuSE 7.1 (here: 2.4.0-4GB). It refuses to load (can be tested
with 'modprobe cvsfs') due to not matching kernel versions (expects 2.4.0 but
system says it is 2.4.0-4GB). Actually i am rather new to kernel programming -
so a hint to solve this problem is welcome.
The build process expects the kernel source is installed at /usr/src/linux


Limitations:
------------
This tool actually only retrieves the file names and directories. To assign
the sizes and dates i have to make some more investigation (support is highly
welcome).
There are some timing limits inside the kernel module for responses from
the cvs-pserver. They may exceed for slow remote machines. Have a look to
cvsfs/proc.c to change this limitation.
Only the pserver method of cvs is supported. May be extended later.


Resulting files:
----------------
This files a copied by 'make install'. You must be root to do this.

/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/fs/cvsfs/cvsfs.o
/sbin/mount.cvsfs
/usr/bin/cvsmount
/usr/bin/cvsmnt
