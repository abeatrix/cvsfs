Version 1.0.9:
Add license info to the kernel module.
Add /dev and devfs support (latter untested).

Version 1.0.8:
Fix compile errors of the cvsfs kernel module on RedHat installations.
The errors were reported for RedHat 7.0 and 7.2. Others may also be
involved.

Version 1.0.7:
The version 1.0.6 was wrongly packaged. All header files were left out.
Fixed re-release.

Version 1.0.6:

Revamp the source code to be in line with GNU coding standards.
Modified the caching strategy to speed up the scan of the directories.


Version 1.0.5:

Automake and autoconf support added. Thanks to Johan Rydberg.
Allow users to address specific versions of the files in cvs. For
example:
  ls filename@@1.1
  
This will list the file 'filename' with revision '1.1'. The '@@' is
used as delimiter. This should also work for all commands which access
a file by its name (f.e. cat, zip, etc.).
