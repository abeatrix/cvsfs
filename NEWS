Version 1.0.5:

Automake and autoconf support added. Thanks to Johan Rydberg.
Allow users to address specific versions of the files in cvs. For
example:
  ls filename@@1.1
  
This will list the file 'filename' with revision '1.1'. The '@@' is
used as delimiter. This should also work for all commands which access
a file by its name (f.e. cat, zip, etc.).
