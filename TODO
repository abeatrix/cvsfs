Short term:
-----------

* Enable the support for user selectable file and directory attributes.
* Support versioned kernel symbols
* Support write operations to the file system
* File caching for not checked-out files
* Directory caching including version numbers
* View modification (see other files then the ones in HEAD)


Long term:
----------

* Enchance GNU make to support logging via this driver to evaluate the
  file dependencies.
* Adapt for kernel 2.2.x ?
