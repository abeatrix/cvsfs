Short term:
-----------

* Support write operations to the file system
* make behaviour of cvsfsd configurable (/etc/cvsfs.conf ?):
  - where to place the cvs cache (actually: /var/cache/cvsfs)
  - modify debug level
  - cache cleanup
  - ...


Long term:
----------

* Enchance GNU make to support logging via this driver to evaluate the
  file dependencies.
* Adapt for kernel 2.2.x ?
* allow > 2GB files (i.e. 64 Bit filesystem)
