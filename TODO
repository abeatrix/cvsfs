Short term:
-----------

* Apply a method to detect changes at the remote CVS repository
  (maybe by frequent tree queries to the CVS server)
* make behaviour of cvsfsd configurable (/etc/cvsfs.conf ?):
  - where to place the cvs cache (actually: /var/cache/cvsfs)
  - modify debug level
  - cache cleanup
  - ...
* IOCTL interface for checkin/checkout
* IOCTL interface to get a version tree of a CVS file
* GUI Interface to display version tree (volunteers welcome)


Long term:
----------

* Enchance GNU make to support logging via this driver to evaluate the
  file dependencies.
* Adapt for kernel 2.2.x ?
* allow > 2GB files (i.e. 64 Bit file system)
* Support other remote filesystems like
  - ftp
  - ...
* Support CD 'write system' which which overlays a CD contents with a
  writeable layer. The enables to 'update' a CD without the necessity
  to
  - copy the CD contents to the local disk
  - update the files
  - burn a new CD
